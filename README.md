# names
I'm tired of spelling my name for fast food joints and Walmart pickups :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

This python file reads data from the `NationalNames.csv` file found in this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names?select=NationalNames.csv).
You can run the file with the following command line inputs:
1. your name
2. (optional) gender of your name: default 'F'
3. (optional) minimum frequency of the suggested name(s) (in 1000s): default 10
4. (optional) number of suggested names: default 10

Ties will be broken by the commonest name winning and then alphabetically.
