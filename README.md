# names
I'm tired of spelling my name for fast food joints and Walmart pickups :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

This python file reads data from the `NationalNames.csv` file found in this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names?select=NationalNames.csv).
You can run the file with the following command line inputs:
1. your name
2. (optional) -g: gender of your name --- default 'F'
3. (optional) -s: Starting letter of the suggested names --- default None
4. (optional) -l: maximum length of suggested names --- default equal to your name
5. (optional) -n: number of suggested names --- default 10

Ties will be broken alphabetically.
