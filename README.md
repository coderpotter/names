# names
I'm tired of spelling my name for fast food joints and Walmart pickups :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

This python file reads data from the `NationalNames.csv` file found in this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names?select=NationalNames.csv). It then takes your name as the 1st command line input, the gender of your name as 2nd (optional), and the year of the name's last use as the 3rd input (also optional).

It will then suggest you top 10 names that match the most closely to your name (more names can be listed by a 4th optional command line input: number of names). Ties will be broken by the latest name winning and then alphabetically.
